# # What does it do?
So the intended purpose of this application is to save the amount of time it would normally take for an individual to brainstorm ticket numbers for a particular lottery. Also , to prevent any loss of ticket numbers themselves by accurately documenting each users drawn and played numbers , including its time and date and storing them in each users numbers profile. Additional features of this application is allowing for a user to browse all previously drawn and winning numbers with extra functionality to scramble even those to generate a new lotter number for a given game.

Implementing the feature of a user generating a number from previously unwinning drawn numbers was thought of due to the fact that there may be a higher probability an individual may win with such a selection of  randomized numbers!

There are currently no test for this application but new updates and commits will features those as this application is in the making!
